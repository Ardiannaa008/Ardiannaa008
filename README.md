Hi im Ardiana and love building stuff
## ðŸ’» Projects
Iâ€™ve worked on a range of projectsâ€”everything from small business sites to more complex applications:

- **Simple websites** for local shops and small services.
- **Two larger projects** where I focused on more advanced logic, dynamic features, and cleaner architecture.
- A **full-stack site** that integrates **MongoDB** for persistent data.

Check my pinned repositories below to see the highlights.
